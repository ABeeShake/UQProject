Anytime Valid Prediction Sequences: Outline

x_t - covariates
y_t - target
D_t - dataset
f(x;D) - point predictor

Problem Setting:
1. Nature reveals x_t ~ p_t(x)
2. Forecaster produces point prediction \hat{y}_t = f(x_t;D_{t-1})
3. Nature reveals y_t ~ p_t(y|x)p(x)

Objective:
1. Create prediction sequences \hat{C}_t such that \mathbb{P}\{y_t \in \hat{C}_t\} \geq 1-\alpha

Idea:
* Create B block-boostrap time series D_{t-1}^b for b \in [B]
* Each D_{t-1}^b leads to a slightly modified point predictor f^b(x;D)
* Using the set of point predictions \{\hat{y}_t^b\}_{b=1}^B estimate the likelihood p(y; x, D)
* Likelihood ratio should be a supermartingdale
* Apply SAVI for time-uniform coverage
